Version 1.5.2 in preparation...\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nWith the CoMap package, you can perform the following tasks:\r\n* Compute probabilistic substitution maps, possibly with biochemical weights (comap)\r\n* Compute coevolution statistics (correlation, compensation) for all pairs of sites (comap)\r\n* Test for significance of pairwise statistics using parametric bootstrap (comap)\r\n* Cluster sites according to a coevolution distance (correlation, compensation) (comap)\r\n* Test for significance of groups using parametric bootstrap (comap + R script)\r\n* Perform correction for multiple testing with group statistics (R script)\r\n* Test if given candidate groups of sites are significantly coevolving (comap)\r\n* Compute mutual information (MI) based statistics for all pairs of sites (mica)\r\n* Test significance of MI statistics using various methods (mica)\r\n* Advanced test of significance of MI statistics, accounting for site-specific substitution rates (mica + R script)  \r\n\r\n# Getting CoMap\r\n\r\n#### Binary packages\r\n\r\n* Debian packages (generated under ubuntu): add the Bio++ repository to your package manager (see http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/wiki/index.php/Installation). Then install comap directly from the package manager.\r\n\r\n* RPM packages (generated using the Suse Open Build Service): http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Ajdutheil%3ABio%2B%2B2.2.0&package=comap\r\n\r\n#### Standalone executables\r\n\r\n(Linux only). Available for 32 and 64 bits computers at http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/repos/exe\r\n\r\n#### MacOSX / Homebrew\r\n\r\nAdd the Bio++ tap to your homebrew installation:\r\n```bash\r\nbrew tap jydu/homebrew-biopp\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, install comap using\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install comap\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### From source\r\n\r\nCoMap is on Github and is open source. CoMap uses the Bio++ libraries (bpp-core, bpp-seq and bpp-phyl, see http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr). Code for the stable versions can be obtained from the Bio++ forge (http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/repos/sources/comap/).\r\n\r\n#### Older versions\r\n\r\nare available at http://download.gna.org/comap.\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nThe documentation of the program is distributed along with the program source code.\r\n\r\nExample data sets are distributed along with the source code. The 'simple' analyses example contain the minimal set of options required. For more advanced usage, the user can look at the example analyses from the 2007 paper. All examples are updated as the program options change.\r\n\r\n# Citation\r\n\r\nCite the following article if you use the pairwise method:\r\n\r\n> Dutheil J, Pupko T, Jean-Marie A, Galtier N.\r\n> A model-based approach for detecting coevolving positions in a molecule.\r\n> Mol Biol Evol. 2005 Sep;22(9):1919-28.\r\n\r\nCite the following article if you use the clustering method:\r\n\r\n> Dutheil J, Galtier N.\r\n> Detecting groups of co-evolving positions in a molecule: a clustering approach.\r\n> BMC Evol Biol. 2007 Nov 30;7(1):242\r\n\r\nCite the following article if you use the candidate approach method:\r\n\r\n> Dutheil JY, Jossinet F, Westhof E.\r\n> Base pairing constraints drive structural epistasis in ribosomal RNA sequences.\r\n> Mol Biol Evol. 2010 Aug;27(8):1868-76\r\n\r\nMICA and the new p-value computation algorithm are described in:\r\n\r\n> Dutheil JY.\r\n> Detecting coevolving positions in a molecule: why and how to account for phylogeny.\r\n> Brief Bioinform. 2011 Sep 24.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
